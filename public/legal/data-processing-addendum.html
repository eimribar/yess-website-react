                <h2>2. <strong>PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA</strong></h2>
                <p>2.1 Roles of the parties. The Parties acknowledge and agree that with regard to the Processing of Personal Data solely on behalf of Customer, (i) Customer is the Controller of Personal Data, (ii) Yess is the Processor of such Personal Data. The terms “Controller” and “Processor” below hereby signify Customer and Yess, respectively.  <br></p>
                <p>2.2 Controller’s use of Personal Data. Customer, in its use of the Services, and Customer’s instructions to the Processor, shall comply with Data Protection Laws. Customer shall establish and have any and all required legal bases in order to collect, Process and transfer to Processor the Personal Data, to authorize the Processing by Processor, and for Processor’s Processing activities on Customer’s behalf, including the pursuit of ‘business purposes’ as defined under the CCPA.<br></p>
                <p>2.3 Processor’s Processing of Personal Data. When Processing on Customer’s behalf under the Agreement, Processor shall Process Personal Data for the following purposes: (i) Processing in accordance with the Agreement and this DPA; (ii) Processing for Customer as part of its provision of the Services; (iii) Processing to comply with Customer’s reasonable and documented instructions, where such instructions are consistent with the terms of the Agreement, regarding the manner in which the Processing shall be performed; (iv) rendering Personal Data fully anonymous, non-identifiable and non-personal in accordance with applicable standards recognized by Data Protection Laws and guidance issued thereunder; (v) Processing as required under the laws applicable to Processor, and/or as required by a court of competent jurisdiction or other competent governmental or semi-governmental authority, provided that Processor shall inform Customer of the legal requirement before Processing, unless such law or order prohibits such information on important grounds of public interest.  <br><br>In the event that Customer discloses or otherwise makes available to Processor Deidentified Data (as defined by applicable Data Protection Laws), Processor shall (i) take reasonable measures to ensure that such data cannot be associated with a natural person, and (ii) maintain and use such data without attempting to re-identify it.<br><br>To the extent that Processor cannot comply with an instruction from Customer because, for example, in Processor’s opinion, such instruction infringes applicable Data Protection Law, (i) Processor shall inform Customer, providing relevant details of the issue, (ii) Processor may, without liability to Customer or to any third party, temporarily cease all Processing of the affected Personal Data (other than securely storing such data) and/or suspend Customer’s access to the Services, and (iii) if the Parties do not agree on a resolution to the issue in question and the costs thereof, Customer may, as its sole remedy, terminate the Agreement and this DPA with respect to the affected Processing, and Customer shall pay to Processor all the amounts owed to Processor or due before the date of termination, or Processor may terminate the Agreement and this DPA with respect to the affected Processing, and Customer shall pay to Processor all the amounts owed to Processor or due before the date of termination. Customer will have no further claims against Processor (including, without limitation, requesting refunds for Services) and against any third party and Processor shall not incur any liability pursuant to the termination of the Agreement and the DPA as described in this paragraph.<br></p>
                <p>2.4 Details of the Processing TThe subject-matter of Processing of Personal Data by Processor is the performance of the Services pursuant to the Agreement and the purposes set forth in this DPA. The duration of the Processing, the nature and purpose of the Processing, the types of Personal Data and categories of Data Subjects Processed under this DPA are further specified in <strong>Schedule 1</strong> (Details of Processing) to this DPA.<br></p>
                <p>2.5 Sensitive data. The Parties agree that the Services are not intended for the processing of Sensitive Data, and that if Customer wishes to use the Services to process Sensitive Data, it must first obtain the Processor’s explicit prior written consent and enter into any additional agreements as required by Yess. <br></p>
                <p>2.6 CCPA Terms. If Customer is a Business under the CCPA, and Yess Processes Personal Data hereunder that is subject to the CCPA, the terms set forth in <strong>Schedule 3</strong> (CCPA Terms) hereto shall apply and bind the Parties with regard to such Personal Data and the Processing itself.  <br></p>
                <h2>3. <strong>DATA SUBJECT REQUESTS</strong></h2>
                <p>Processor shall, to the extent legally permitted, notify Customer or refer Data Subject to Customer, if Processor receives a request from a Data Subject to exercise their rights (to the extent available to them under applicable Data Protection Laws) such as the right of access, rectification, restriction of Processing, erasure, data portability, objection to the Processing, or their right not to be subject to automated individual decision making (“<strong>Data Subject Request/s</strong>”). Taking into account the nature of the Processing, Processor shall make reasonable commercial efforts to assist Customer by implementing appropriate technical and organizational measures, insofar as this is possible and reasonable, for the fulfillment of Customer’s obligation to respond to a Data Subject Request under Data Protection Laws. Processor may refer Data Subject Requests received, and the Data Subjects making them, directly to the Customer for its treatment of such requests.<br></p>
                <h2>4. <strong>CONFIDENTIALITY</strong></h2>
                <p>Processor shall ensure that its personnel and advisors engaged in the Processing of Personal Data have contractually committed themselves to confidentiality.</p>
                <h2>5. <strong>SUB-PROCESSORS</strong></h2>
                <p>5.1 Appointment of Sub-processors. Customer acknowledges and agrees that (a) Processor’s Affiliates may be engaged as Sub-processors; and (b) Processor and Processor’s Affiliates on behalf of Processor may each engage third-party Sub-processors in connection with the provision of the Services.<br></p>
                <p>5.2 List of Current Sub-processors and Notification of New Sub-processors. Yess makes available to Customer the current list of Sub-processors used by Processor to process Personal Data, accessible at <a href="https://www.yess.ai/legal/sub-processors">https://www.yess.ai/legal/sub-processors</a>. Such Sub-processor list includes the identities of those Sub-processors, the location of the Processing and the type of service rendered by each Sub-processor (“<strong>Sub-Processor List</strong>”). The Sub-Processor List as of the date of first use of the Services by Customer is hereby deemed authorized upon first use of the Services. Processor’s webpage-accessible Sub-Processors List offers a mechanism to subscribe to notifications of new Sub-processors, to which Customer shall subscribe, and when Customer subscribes, Processor shall provide notification of any new Sub-processor(s) at least ten (10) days before engaging such new Sub-processor(s) to Process Personal Data in connection with the provision of the Services.<br></p>
                <p>5.3 Objection to New Sub-processors. Customer may reasonably object to Processor’s use of a new Sub-processor, for reasons relating to the protection of Personal Data intended to be Processed by such Sub-processor, by notifying Processor promptly in writing to <a href="mailto:privacy@yess.ai">privacy@yess.ai</a> within ten (10) days after receipt of notice by the Processor of such new appointment. Such written objection shall include the reasons for objecting to Processor’s use of such new Sub-processor. Failure to object to such new Sub-processor in writing within ten (10) days following Processor’s notice shall be deemed as acceptance of the new Sub-Processor. In the event Customer reasonably objects to a new Sub-processor, as permitted in the preceding sentences, Processor will use reasonable efforts to make available to Customer a change in the Services or recommend a commercially reasonable change to Customer’s configuration or use of the Services to avoid Processing of Personal Data by the objected-to new Sub-processor without unreasonably burdening the Customer. If Processor is unable to make available such change within thirty (30) days, Customer may, as a sole remedy, terminate the applicable Agreement and this DPA with respect only to those Services which cannot be provided by Processor without the use of the objected-to new Sub-processor, by providing written notice to Processor. All amounts due under the Agreement before the termination date with respect to the Processing at issue shall be duly paid to Processor. Until a decision is made regarding the new Sub-processor, Processor may temporarily suspend the Processing of the affected Personal Data and/or suspend access to the Services, without incurring any liability. Customer will have no further claims against Processor due to the termination of the Agreement (including, without limitation, requesting refunds) and/or the DPA and/or the suspension of Services in the situation described in this paragraph.<br></p>
                <p>5.4 Agreements with Sub-processors. Processor or a Processor’s Affiliate on behalf of Processor has entered into a written agreement with each Sub-processor containing appropriate safeguards to the protection of Personal Data. Where Processor engages a Sub-processor for carrying out specific Processing activities on behalf of the Customer, the same or materially similar data protection obligations as set out in this DPA shall be imposed on such new Sub-processor by way of a written contract, in particular obligations to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures in such a manner that the Processing will meet the requirements of Data Protection Laws. Where a Sub-processor fails to fulfill its data protection obligations concerning its Processing of Personal Data, Processor shall remain responsible for the performance of the Sub-processor&#x27;s obligations.<br></p>
                <h2>6. <strong>SECURITY &amp; AUDITS</strong></h2>
                <p>6.1 Controls for the Protection of Personal Data. Processor shall maintain industry-standard technical and organizational measures for protection of Personal Data Processed hereunder (including protection against unauthorized or unlawful Processing and against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss or alteration or damage, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to, Personal Data, confidentiality and integrity of Personal Data, including those measures set forth in the Security Documentation), as may be amended from time to time. Upon the Customer’s reasonable request, Processor will reasonably assist Customer, at Customer’s cost and subject to the provisions of Section ‎‎11.1 below, in ensuring compliance with the obligations pursuant to Articles 32 to 36 of the GDPR, taking into account the nature of the Processing and the information available to Processor.<br></p>
                <p>6.2 Audits and Inspections. Upon Customer’s thirty (30) days’ prior written request at reasonable intervals (no more than once every twelve (12) months), and subject to strict confidentiality undertakings by Customer, Processor shall make available to Customer that is not a competitor of Processor or any of its Affiliates (or Customer’s independent, reputable, third-party auditor that is not a competitor of Processor or any of its Affiliates and not in conflict with Processor or any of its Affiliates, subject to their confidentiality and non-compete undertakings) information necessary to demonstrate compliance with Data Protection Laws and this DPA, and allow for and contribute to audits, including inspections, conducted by them (provided, however, that such information, audits, inspections and the results therefrom, including the documents reflecting the outcome of the audit and/or the inspections, shall only be used by Customer to assess compliance with this DPA, and shall not be used for any other purpose or disclosed to any third party without Processor’s prior written approval. Upon Processor&#x27;s first request, Customer shall return all records or documentation in Customer&#x27;s possession or control provided by Processor in the context of the audit and/or the inspection). If and to the extent that the Standard Contractual Clauses apply, nothing in this Section ‎6.2 varies or modifies the Standard Contractual Clauses nor affects any Supervisory Authority’s or Data Subject’s rights under the Standard Contractual Clauses.<br></p>
                <p>6.3 Objection to New Sub-processors. In the event of an audit or inspections as set forth above, Customer shall ensure that it (and each of its mandated auditors) will not cause (or, if it cannot avoid, minimize) any damage, injury or disruption to Processor’s premises, equipment, personnel and business while conducting such audit or inspection.<br></p>
                <p>6.4 Agreements with Sub-processors. The audit rights set forth in Section ‎6.2 above shall only apply to the extent that the Agreement does not otherwise provide Customer with audit rights that meet the relevant requirements of Data Protection Laws (including, where applicable, Article 28(3)(h) of the GDPR or the UK GDPR).<br></p>
                <h2>7. <strong>DATA INCIDENT MANAGEMENT AND NOTIFICATION</strong></h2>
                <p>Processor maintains security incident management policies and procedures and, to the extent required under applicable Data Protection Laws, shall notify Customer without undue delay after becoming aware of the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to Personal Data Processed by Processor on behalf of the Customer (a “<strong>Data Incident</strong>”). Processor shall make reasonable efforts to identify and take those steps as Processor deems necessary and reasonable in order to remediate and/or mitigate the cause of such Data Incident to the extent the remediation and/or mitigation is within Processor’s reasonable control. Customer will not make, disclose, release or publish any finding, admission of liability, communication, notice, press release or report concerning any Data Incident which directly or indirectly identifies Processor or any Sub-Processor (including in any legal proceeding or in any notification to Supervisory Authorities, other regulatory authorities or affected individuals, and excluding disclosure to third-party consultants and advisors of Customer that are subject to appropriate confidentiality undertakings) without Processor’s prior written approval, unless, and solely to the extent that, Customer is compelled to do so in order to notify any competent data protection authority of a Data Incident in a mandatory manner prescribed by such authority, or pursuant to applicable Data Protection Laws. In the latter case, unless prohibited by such laws, Customer shall provide Processor with reasonable prior written notice to provide Processor with the opportunity to object to such disclosure, and in any case, Customer will limit the disclosure to the minimum scope required.</p>
                <h2>8. <strong>RETURN AND DELETION OF PERSONAL DATA</strong></h2>
                <p>Within sixty (60) days following termination of the Agreement and subject thereto, Processor shall, at the choice of Customer (indicated in writing to Processor), delete or return to Customer all the Personal Data it Processes solely on behalf of the Customer, and Processor shall delete existing copies of such Personal Data unless Data Protection Laws require otherwise. To the extent authorized or required by applicable law, Processor may also retain one copy of the Personal Data solely for evidence purposes and/or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims and/or for compliance with legal obligations.</p>
                <h2>9. <strong>TRANS-BORDER DATA TRANSFERS</strong></h2>
                <p>9.1 Transfers from the EEA, Switzerland, and the UK to countries that offer an adequate level of data protection. Personal Data may be transferred from EU Member States, the three other EEA member countries (Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland) (collectively, “<strong>EEA</strong>”), Switzerland and the United Kingdom (“<strong>UK</strong>”) to countries that offer an adequate level of data protection under or pursuant to the adequacy decisions published by the relevant data protection authorities of the EEA, the EU, their member countries or the European Commission, Switzerland, and/or the UK as relevant and applicable (“<strong>Adequacy Decisions</strong>”), without any further safeguard being necessary<br>‍<br>9.2 Transfers from the EEA, the UK, and Switzerland to other countries. If the Processing of Personal Data by Processor includes a transfer (either directly or via onward transfer) from the EEA (“<strong>EEA Transfer</strong>”), the UK (“<strong>UK Transfer</strong>”), and/or Switzerland (“<strong>Swiss Transfer</strong>”) to other countries which have not been subject to a relevant Adequacy Decision, and such transfers are not performed through an alternative recognized compliance mechanism for the lawful transfer of personal data (as defined in the GDPR, the UK GDPR, or the FADP, as relevant), then: (i) the terms set forth in Part 1 of <strong>Schedule 2</strong> (EEA Trans-Border Transfers) shall apply to any such EEA Transfer; (ii) the terms set forth in Part 2 of <strong>Schedule 2</strong> (UK Trans-Border Transfers) shall apply to any such UK Transfer; (iii) the terms set forth in Part 3 of <strong>Schedule 2</strong> (Swiss Trans-Border Transfers) shall apply to any such Swiss Transfer; (iv) the terms set forth in Part 4 of <strong>Schedule 2</strong> (Additional Safeguards) shall apply to any such transfers.</p>
                <h2>10. <strong>TRANS-BORDER DATA TRANSFERS</strong></h2>
                <p>10.1 Contractual Relationship. The Parties acknowledge and agree that, by executing the DPA, the Customer enters into the DPA on behalf of itself and, as applicable, in the name and on behalf of its Authorized Affiliates, in which case each Authorized Affiliate agrees to be bound by the Customer’s obligations under this DPA, if and to the extent that Processor Processes Personal Data on the behalf of such Authorized Affiliates, thus qualifying them as the “Controller”. All access to and use of the Services by Authorized Affiliates must comply with the terms and conditions of the Agreement and this DPA and any violation of the terms and conditions therein by an Authorized Affiliate shall be deemed a violation by Customer.<br>‍<br>10.2 Communication. Customer shall remain responsible for coordinating all communication with Processor under the Agreement and this DPA and shall be entitled to make and receive any communication in relation to this DPA on behalf of its Authorized Affiliates.</p>
                <h2>11. <strong>OTHER PROVISIONS</strong></h2>
                <p>11.1 Data Protection Impact Assessment and Prior Consultation. Upon Customer’s reasonable request, Processor shall provide Customer, at Customer’s cost, with reasonable cooperation and assistance needed to fulfil Customer’s obligation under applicable Data Protection Laws to carry out a data protection impact assessment of data protection assessment (as applicable) related to Customer’s use of the Services, to the extent Customer does not otherwise have access to the relevant information, and to the extent such information is available to Processor. Processor shall provide reasonable assistance to Customer in the cooperation or prior consultation with the Supervisory Authority in the performance of its tasks relating to this Section ‎11.1, to the extent required under the GDPR or the UK GDPR, as applicable.<br>‍<br>11.2 Modifications. Each Party may by at least thirty (30) calendar days&#x27; prior written notice to the other Party, request in writing any variations to this DPA if they are required as a result of any change in, or decision of a competent authority under Data Protection Laws, to allow Processing of Personal Data to be made (or continue to be made) without breach of those Data Protection Laws. Pursuant to such notice: (a) The Parties shall make commercially reasonable efforts to accommodate such modification requested by either Party; and (b) Customer shall not unreasonably withhold or delay agreement to any consequential variations to this DPA proposed by Processor to protect the Processor against additional risks, or to indemnify and compensate Processor for any further steps and costs associated with the variations made herein at Customer’s request. The Parties shall promptly discuss the proposed variations and negotiate in good faith with a view to agreeing and implementing those or alternative variations designed to address the requirements identified in Customer’s or Processor’s notice as soon as is reasonably practicable. In the event that the Parties are unable to reach such an agreement within thirty (30) days of such notice, then Customer or Processor may, by written notice to the other Party, with immediate effect, terminate the Agreement and/or the DPA to the extent that it relates to the Services which are affected by the proposed variations (or lack thereof). Customer will have no further claims against Processor (including, without limitation, requesting refunds for the Services) and Processor shall not incur any liability pursuant to the termination of the Agreement and/or the DPA as described in this Section.</p>

                  <li>In the event of an EEA Transfer, a UK Transfer or a Swiss Transfer, the Parties agree to supplement these with the following safeguards and representations, where appropriate:<ul role="list">
                      <li>The Processor shall have in place and maintain in accordance with good industry practice measures to protect the Personal Data from interception (including in transit from the Controller to the Processor and between different systems and services). This includes having in place and maintaining network protection intended to deny attackers the ability to intercept data and encryption of Personal Data whilst in transit and at rest intended to deny attackers the ability to read data.</li>
                      <li>The Processor will make commercially reasonable efforts to resist, subject to applicable laws, any request for bulk surveillance relating to the Personal Data protected under GDPR or the UK GDPR, including under section 702 of the United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (“<strong>FISA</strong>”);</li>
                      <li>If the Processor becomes aware that any government authority (including law enforcement) wishes to obtain access to or a copy of some or all of the Personal Data, whether on a voluntary or a mandatory basis, then unless legally prohibited or under a mandatory legal compulsion that requires otherwise:<ul role="list">
                          <li>The Processor shall inform the relevant government authority that the Processor is a processor of the Personal Data and that the Controller has not authorized the Processor to disclose the Personal Data to the government authority, and inform the relevant government authority that any and all requests or demands for access to the Personal Data should therefore be notified to or served upon the Controller in writing;</li>
                          <li>The Processor will use commercially reasonable legal mechanisms to challenge any such demand for access to Personal Data which is under the Processor’s control. Notwithstanding the above, (a) the Controller acknowledges that such challenge may not always be reasonable or possible in light of the nature, scope, context and purposes of the intended government authority access, and (b) if, taking into account the nature, scope, context and purposes of the intended government authority access to Personal Data, the Processor has a reasonable and good-faith belief that urgent access is necessary to prevent an imminent risk of serious harm to any individual or entity, this subsection (c)(II) shall not apply. In such event, the Processor shall notify the Controller, as soon as possible, following the access by the government authority, and provide the Controller with relevant details of the same, unless and to the extent legally prohibited to do so.</li>
                        </ul>
                      </li>

                  </li>
                  <li>Once in every 12-month period, the Processor will inform the Controller, at the Controller’s written request, of the types of binding legal demands for Personal Data it has received and solely to the extent such demands have been received, including national security orders and directives, which shall encompass any process issued under section 702 of FISA.</li>

                <h2><strong>SCHEDULE 3 – CCPA TERMS</strong></h2>
                <p><strong>1. SCOPE, APPLICATION &amp; INTERPRETATION</strong></p>
                <p>1.1 This <strong>Schedule 3</strong> shall apply and bind the Parties if and to the extent that (i) Customer is a Business under the CCPA, and (ii) Yess Processes Personal Information (as defined below) that is subject to the CCPA in the course of providing the Services to Customer pursuant to the Agreement.<br></p>
                <p>1.2 This <strong>Schedule 3</strong> prevails over any conflicting terms of the Agreement or the DPA but does not otherwise modify the Agreement or the DPA.<br></p>
                <p>1.3 This <strong>Schedule 3</strong> shall be interpreted in favor of the Parties’ intent to comply with the CCPA, and therefore any ambiguity shall be resolved in favor of a meaning that complies and is consistent with the CCPA.<br></p>
                <p>1.4 Capitalized terms not specifically defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the DPA, as amended by this <strong>Schedule 3.</strong><br></p>
                <p><strong>2. DEFINITIONS</strong></p>
                <p>2.1 The terms “<strong>Business</strong>”, “<strong>Collects</strong>” (and “collected” and “collection”), “<strong>Consumer</strong>”, “<strong>Business Purpose</strong>”, “<strong>Sell</strong>” (and “selling”, “sale”, and “sold”), “<strong>Share</strong>” (and “shared”, or “sharing”), and “<strong>Service Provider</strong>” shall each have the same meaning as in the CCPA.<br></p>
                <p>2.2 &quot;<strong>Personal Information</strong>&quot; means any information that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, to or with an identified or identifiable Consumer or household of a Consumer, which is processed by Yess solely on behalf of Customer under this <strong>Schedule 3</strong> and the Agreement.<br></p>
                <p><strong>3. PROCESSING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong></p>
                <p>3.1 Customer hereby appoints Yess as a Service Provider to Process Personal Information on behalf of Customer. Customer, in its use of the Services, and Customer’s instructions to Yess, shall comply with the CCPA. Customer represents and warrants that it has provided notice consistent with Section 1798.135 of the CCPA, and has obtained consents to the extent required under the CCPA for Yess to lawfully Collect and Process the Personal Information in pursuit of the Permitted Purposes (as defined in Section ‎‎3.2 below).<br></p>
                <p>3.2 Yess shall Process Personal Information solely for the purposes set forth in Section ‎2.3 of the DPA and as necessary to comply with this <strong>Schedule 3</strong> and the CCPA. For the avoidance of doubt, such Processing shall include the pursuit of Business Purposes, including providing Customer with Yess’ revenue platform designed to help companies streamline sales activities (the &quot;<strong>Permitted Purposes</strong>&quot;).<br></p>
                <p>3.3 Sections ‎3-‎‎8, ‎‎10 and ‎‎11.2 of the DPA shall apply to the Processing of Personal Information and the following terms shall be replaced as follows: &quot;Data Protection Laws&quot; shall mean the CCPA; “DPA” shall mean this <strong>Schedule 3</strong>; &quot;Personal Data&quot; shall mean &quot;Personal Information&quot;; “Data Subject” shall mean “Consumer”; &quot;Controller&quot; shall mean &quot;Business&quot;; &quot;Processor&quot; shall mean &quot;Service Provider&quot;; and Sub-processor shall refer to the concept of a Service Provider engaged by Yess to Process Personal Information.<br></p>
                <p>3.4 Yess shall Process Personal Information in accordance with the provisions of the CCPA, and in a manner that provides the same level of privacy protection to Personal Information as required by the CCPA. Yess certifies that it understands the rules, requirements, and definitions of the CCPA and this <strong>Schedule 3</strong>, and shall comply with them.<br></p>
                <p>3.5 Yess acknowledges and confirms that it does not receive nor process any Personal Information as consideration for any services or other items that Yess provides to Customer under the Agreement. Yess agrees to refrain from Selling and/or Sharing any Personal Information Processed hereunder without Customer’s prior written consent, nor taking any action that would cause any transfer of Personal Information to or from Yess under the Agreement or this <strong>Schedule 3</strong> to qualify as Selling and/or Sharing such Personal Information. Yess shall not have, derive, or exercise any rights or benefits regarding the Personal Information, and shall not retain, use, or disclose any Personal Information (i) for any purpose other than the Permitted Purposes, and/or (ii) outside of the direct business relationship between the Parties.<br></p>
                <p>3.6 Yess shall not combine Personal Information with any other data if and to the extent that this would be inconsistent with the limitations on Service Providers under the CCPA.<br></p>
                <p>3.7 Yess shall notify Customer if Yess makes a determination that it can no longer meet its obligations under this <strong>Schedule 3</strong> and/or the CCPA.</p>
