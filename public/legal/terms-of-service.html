Delinquent payments may bear compounded interest, as of the payment due date and until paid in full, at a rate equal to the lower of: (i) 1.5% per month, or (ii) the highest rate permitted by law. The aforesaid shall not derogate from any other right or remedy to which the Company may be entitled.

                <p>12.3 Termination by Customer. Customer may terminate its Subscription to the Service by cancelling its Subscription, whereby termination will take effect at the end of the then-current Subscription Term and shall not derogate from Customer’s obligation to pay the applicable Fees for the Subscription Term.<br></p>
                <p>12.4 Effect of Termination.
