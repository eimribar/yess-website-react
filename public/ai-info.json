    {
      "question": "What is an Agentic AE and how is it different from other sales AI?",
      "answer": "An Agentic AE is an AI partner that moves beyond passive analysis and into active execution. While other tools suggest what to do, an Agentic AE drafts the emails, prepares the plays, and orchestrates the stakeholders required to win a deal. It's an active executor that handles the manual work, with a human-in-the-loop for final approval, not a passive analyzer that creates more tasks."
